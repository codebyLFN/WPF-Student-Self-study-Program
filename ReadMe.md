# Students self-study hours program

Individuals might use this project as a tool for studying. As a result, people should have a better
understanding of their potential issues. In order for the program to generate an accurate report, 
users will be needed to provide their information.The program will have to be able to store which 
modules a student is doing. Every module is worth a specific number of credits. And that number 
multiplied by ten will be the number of hours spent on it throughout the semester. 
For example, PROG6212 is 15 credits, so 150 hours should be spent on it. Some of that will be 
in class, and the rest will have to be distributed throughout the weeks.
